<h2 style="display: inline;">Hey!</h2><p style="display: inline;"> I'm Luca, an AI enthusiast and current Master's student in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Amsterdam. My academic focus lies in graph algorithms and representational learning, building upon a solid foundation in Computer Science and Engineering from TU Delft.<br><br></p>   

<p style="display: inline;">During my academic journey, I've contributed to several significant projects, including a fairness-enhanced graph algorithm which earned recognition at the MLRC and secured a Kaggle research grant (more on the <a href="/projects/">Projects</a> page). <br><br></p>   

<p style="display: inline;"> In addition to my studies, I served as a Lead Engineer for <a href="https://www.teamepoch.net/">TU Delft's AI Student Team</a>, leading our group to a top-10 finish in the competitive AWS DeepRacer RL Challenge. These experiences have fueled my passion for the practical applications of AI, particularly its responsible and impactful deployment in various sectors.<br><br></p>


<p style="display: inline;">Outside the realm of AI, I love for mountain biking and traveling. Whether it's exploring a new trail or algorithm, I am driven by discovery and innovation. ðŸš€</p>
